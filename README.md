Take back your power, and use decentralized technology


The goal of this project is simple.  I needed a place to publish my ideas in an easy to use, censorship resistant manner.  Blockchains already exist, however, writing data to and extracting data from a block explorer in a usable format can be intimidating for a beginning user. (For example, here is the transaction for the instantiation of the coin https://polygonscan.com/token/0xb1B6415b23a40a75b913faBAA1505503BD49eCf3).  In order to write that transction, I needed to use  To ease


IPFS + POLYGON + UPCs = UNSTOPPABLE transfer of ideas and value!







Welcome to UPC Band Radio!
*Mission: Harness the existing UPC Grid Infastructure to provide high value quality entertainment for the vehicle (and home) \n 
*Each UPC code is a UNIQUE Metaverse server!  {{hack}} it, {{pwn}} it, and then {{upload}} your [[intelligence]]\n 
*Perfect for TRUCKERS, indie journalists, indie artists, organizations seeking donations,indie actors/acrtesses, and Sovereign individuals who are sick of Big Tech/Corporations snooping around in our data, running our lives and PWNING our data. \n 
*Get paid on YOUR terms by SELLING YOUR [[intelligence]] as a UPC NFT and accept MATIC DIRECTLY to YOUR UPC code! \n 
*Every day new UPCs are declared as `coinboxes`.  First x number of users with Leveled Up Scanners can grab free coins from the coinboxes. \n *Every day, the default UPC [[777777777777]] is updated. Check back Often!  This is your Self Owned Shared Crypto News and Intelligence Platform built on a fully decentralized stack (IPFS, POLYGON, UPC Codes) \n 
*Record a video or take a pic and upload to [["+this.state.account+"]]! \n 
*Each UPC has a default VR zone.  Just type the `vr` command! * \n 
*Mirror (xvr) your centralized censroable videos to the UPCs, and upload (xpayload) them for safekeeping \n  

*Each UPC Code can be bought and sold for around 1 MATIC

Tokenomics
* Initially, 100 Trillion Keyz tokens (0xb1B6415b23a40a75b913faBAA1505503BD49eCf3) were minted. Proof [https://polygonscan.com/token/0xb1B6415b23a40a75b913faBAA1505503BD49eCf3]. Each one of these 100 trillion tokens (1 Keyz) provides one unit of utility.  Each 1 Keyz token can be used to tokenize 1 UPC code (In other words, each Keyz will allow you to successfully create transactions with the {{hack}} & {{pwn}} commands.  After these commands complete, you will have 1 RollinOnUPC NFT in your wallet!).
There is a DEX built into the wallet.  Users can {{swap}} MATIC for Keyz 1:1 using the {{swap}} command.  This is one way of getting Keyz, however, there is another way to get Keyz so that you can tokenize some UPCs.  As a human being, I would like to include the traditionally unincludables into my economy for both moral and strategic reasons.  Since I have 100 Trillion units of verifiable value, a homeless person can sell these for me, and be selling "nothing", yet selling something.  I have created a DEX for the homeless or more broadly folks who have been deemed "untouchables" by society.  These affected individuals can now compete with me and undercut my price!  I will intentionally set the {{swap}} price to a little above 1 matic to incentivize the "untouchables" to price their coins cheaper than mine so that they can sell their coins before I unload all of the rest of mine!  Since the homeless are the ones doing the work, they get 90% of the sale, and the market (smart contract IE me) gets 10% on each sale.

* When a user tokenizes a UPC code (ie. the user has successfully executed the {{hack}} and {{pwn}} commands on the previously unowned UPC MicroServer that they have scanned), they are the owner of the server.  A server has a front stage, a back stage, and all sorts of metadata inside of it.  The user who owns the UPC code (a UPC Developer!) can program the UPC code, and then easily express the resource as a UPCScript!  One use case is for a homeless person, but any person can be substituted.  The scenerio is that the user found an interesting product package and they want to tokenize the UPC [[766868331174]].  Next, they scan, {{hack}} and {{pwn}} the microserver. they would be able to upload a single video about (possibly) street life or whatever else they desire.  They can then {{flip}} the UPC NFT in our decentralized marketplace, and instantly (as soon as there is a buyer) get  paid!
